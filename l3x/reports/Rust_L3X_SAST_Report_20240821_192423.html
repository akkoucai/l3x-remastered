        <h3>Summary of Findings from SAST Tool</h3>
<h4>High Severity Issues:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overflow/Underflow Risks</strong> (ID: RUST012, RUST021):</p>
<ul>
<li>Found at multiple lines (59, 65, 66, 69, 82, 106, 124, 143, 46, 66, 79, 92, 97, 99, 108).</li>
<li>Arithmetic operations are performed without checks for overflow or underflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authorization and State Modifications Risks</strong> (IDs: VULN008, VULN009, VULN010):</p>
<ul>
<li>Found at lines (40, 41, 42, 81, 82, 83, 110, 111, 112).</li>
<li>Ensure expected signer accounts have signed, state accounts are writable, and verify owner to prevent unauthorized modifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Medium Severity Issues:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unwrapping Results/Options</strong> (IDs: RUST002, RUST024, Rust-Solana002):</p>
<ul>
<li>Found at multiple lines (97, 114, 133, 44, 74, 103).</li>
<li>Unwrapping without proper error handling may lead to panics; prefer using <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Array/Vector Boundary Checks</strong> (ID: Rust-Solana007):</p>
<ul>
<li>Found at multiple lines (17, 18, 19, 34, 38, 62).</li>
<li>Accessing arrays or vectors without boundary checks can lead to panics or buffer overflows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloning Large Data Structures</strong> (ID: Rust-Solana008):</p>
<ul>
<li>Found at line 61.</li>
<li>Potential performance issues due to excessive memory use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement checks for arithmetic operations to handle potential overflow or underflow.</li>
<li>Enhance error handling by replacing <code>unwrap()</code> and <code>expect()</code> with appropriate error handling techniques.</li>
<li>Ensure proper signing and validation of account states to strengthen security.</li>
<li>Add boundary checks when accessing arrays or vectors to avoid potential panics or crashes.</li>
</ul>
