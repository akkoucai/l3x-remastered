    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class='markdown-summary'>
        <p><strong>Summary of Findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>High Severity Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unchecked Arithmetic Operations (RUST012, RUST021):</strong> Numerous instances of arithmetic operations across various lines in <code>lib.rs</code> and <code>processor.rs</code> can lead to overflow or underflow without being checked, posing a critical risk.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization &amp; Data Integrity Vulnerabilities (VULN008, VULN009, VULN010):</strong> Multiple lines in <code>processor.rs</code> expose the application to unauthorized modifications, fake data injection, and unauthorized account signature issues due to lack of proper verification checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium Severity Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panic Risks from Unchecked <code>unwrap()</code> or <code>expect()</code> (RUST002, RUST024, Rust-Solana002):</strong> Several lines in <code>lib.rs</code> and <code>processor.rs</code> use <code>unwrap()</code> or <code>expect()</code> without proper error handling, risking application panics.</li>
<li><strong>Array/Vector Bounds Check Omissions (Rust-Solana007):</strong> There are multiple instances where arrays or vectors are accessed without appropriate boundary checks, which can lead to buffer overflows or panics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low Severity Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloning Large Data Structures (Rust-Solana008):</strong> Cloning of large structures is observed, which may lead to performance degradation due to excessive memory usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The findings indicate that there are significant security risks due to unchecked arithmetic operations, potential authorization bypasses, and error handling oversights that need immediate attention to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the application.</p>
