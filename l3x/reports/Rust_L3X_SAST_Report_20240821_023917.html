    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class='markdown-summary'>
        <p>The Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool identified several issues in the Rust code located in <code>lib.rs</code> and <code>processor.rs</code> files of the project. Hereâ€™s a summary of the findings:</p>
<h3>High Severity Issues:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow (RUST012, RUST021)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple instances (lines 59, 65, 66, 69, 46, 66, 92, 97, 99, 117, 148, 149, 156, 157) where arithmetic operations can overflow or underflow without checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unauthorized Account Modifications (VULN008)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple instances (lines 40, 41, 42, 81, 82, 83, 110, 111, 112, 137, 138, 139) where it's necessary to ensure the expected signer account has signed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unwritable State Accounts (VULN009)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the above, it's important to check that state accounts are writable to prevent unauthorized modifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification of State Accounts Owner (VULN010)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeated need (lines 40, 41, 42, 81, 82, 83, 110, 111, 112, 137, 138, 139) to verify the owner of state accounts to avoid fake data injection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Medium Severity Issues:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unwrapping Issues (RUST002, RUST024, Rust-Solana002)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines 97, 74, 103, 130, 160 indicate unwrapping of <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code> without handling errors or over-reliance on <code>unwrap()</code> and <code>expect()</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Array Access Without Boundary Checks (Rust-Solana007)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instances (lines 17, 18, 34, 62) that access arrays or vectors without ensuring valid indices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Low Severity Issues:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clone Performance Issues (Rust-Solana008)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lines 61, 121 highlight potential performance problems due to cloning large data structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The analysis reveals numerous high-severity and medium-severity vulnerabilities mainly related to unchecked arithmetic operations, poor error handling, and security risks pertaining to account verification. Addressing these issues is crucial for the overall security and stability of the application.</p>
