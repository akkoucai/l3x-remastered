    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class='markdown-summary'>
        <p>Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the Static Application Security Testing (SAST) findings from <code>processor.rs</code>:</p>
<h3>High-Severity Issues:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow (Multiple Instances)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 19, 38, 46, 66, 79, 92, 97, 99, 108, 113, 117, 124, 135, 140, 148, 149, 151, 156, 157</li>
<li>Description: Multiple instances of unchecked arithmetic operations that can lead to overflow or underflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signer and State Account Verification (Multiple Instances)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 40, 41, 42, 81, 82, 83, 110, 111, 112, 137, 138, 139</li>
<li>Description: Needed checks to ensure that the expected signer account has signed, state accounts are writable, and the owner of state accounts is verified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Medium-Severity Issues:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Array/Vector Access (Multiple Instances)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 17, 18, 19, 34, 38, 44, 62, 74, 79, 135</li>
<li>Description: Accessing arrays or vectors without boundary checks, which may lead to panics or buffer overflows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Result/Option Unwrapping (Multiple Instances)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 44, 74, 103, 130, 160</li>
<li>Description: Unwrapping a Result or Option without proper error handling, leading to potential panics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overusing <code>unwrap()</code> or <code>expect()</code> (Multiple Instances)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 44, 74, 103, 130, 160</li>
<li>Description: Excessive use of methods that can result in panics; encourage using error-handling mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Low-Severity Issue:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cloning Large Data Structures (Multiple Instances)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lines: 61, 121</li>
<li>Description: Cloning large data structures may cause performance issues due to high memory consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The findings indicate critical concerns about unchecked arithmetic operations and insufficient verification on signer and state accounts. Additionally, the code demonstrates risks from improper handling of array accesses and panic-inducing unwraps, warranting prompt attention for security and stability improvements.</p>
