    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class='markdown-summary'>
        <p>The Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool identified several security and performance issues in the codebase, summarized as follows:</p>
<h3><strong>High Severity Issues:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow (RUST021)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines</strong>: 42, 74, 79, 92, 111, 112, 118, 119</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Arithmetic operations may cause overflow or underflow, potentially leading to data corruption or crashes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signer and Account Validation (VULN008, VULN009, VULN010)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines</strong>: 29, 30, 31, 32, 87, 88, 89, 104, 105, 106, 107</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: There are numerous instances where the code does not ensure that the expected signer account has signed, nor does it properly validate state account writability and ownership. This can open the application to unauthorized modifications and fake data injection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Medium Severity Issues:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Boundary Checks for Arrays or Vectors (Rust-Solana007)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines</strong>: 17, 18, 54, 69</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Lack of boundary checks when accessing arrays or vectors, which could lead to panics or buffer overflows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unwrapping Without Proper Error Handling (RUST002, RUST024, Rust-Solana002)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines</strong>: 80</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Unwarranted <code>unwrap()</code> or <code>expect()</code> usage without proper error handling, increasing the risk of panics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Low Severity Issues:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cloning Large Data Structures (Rust-Solana008)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines</strong>: 53, 65, 96</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Cloning large data structures can lead to performance issues due to excessive memory usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Overall Summary</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The code contains critical vulnerabilities related to arithmetic operations, account validation, and unvalidated access to data structures.</li>
<li>There are performance concerns related to cloning large data structures and missing boundary checks that might lead to runtime errors or panics.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues should be addressed to improve the security and robustness of the codebase.</p>

                <td>The RUST021 identifier likely refers to potential security concerns related to the use of the `Clone` and `Copy` traits on sensitive data types. In this context, these traits are applied to the `Wallet` struct, which includes `Pubkey` fields representing the authority and vault addresses.

The `Copy` trait enables bitwise copying of the data, which is safe in this case because the `Pubkey` type is immutable and not sensitive. The `Clone` trait allows explicit copying, which is also not a security issue here because the public keys (as represented by `Pubkey`) are public information by design and do not contain any secret or sensitive values that need protection from cloning.

Therefore, given that the use of `Clone` and `Copy` on public key structures is standard and does not introduce any security risks, this finding is a false positive. No fixed or improvement is needed in this context.</td>  <!-- Add explanation column -->
