        <h3>Summary of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Findings</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Array and Vector Boundary Checks (Medium Severity)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 18, 19, 51</li>
<li>Issues related to accessing arrays or vectors without boundary checks, potentially leading to panics or buffer overflows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unauthorized Account Modifications (High Severity)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 31, 32, 33, 68, 69, 84, 85, 86</li>
<li>Multiple occurrences highlight the need to ensure:
<ul>
<li>Expected signer accounts have signed transactions.</li>
<li>State accounts are checked for writability.</li>
<li>Owners of state accounts are verified to prevent unauthorized modifications and data injection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Operations (High Severity)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 38, 55, 59, 90, 96, 97, 100</li>
<li>Concerns about potential overflows or underflows in arithmetic operations without appropriate checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling and Unwrapping (Medium Severity)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 60, 101</li>
<li>Warnings regarding the overuse of <code>unwrap()</code> and <code>expect()</code>, which can lead to panics. Recommendations to use more robust error handling mechanisms like <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloning Large Data Structures (Low Severity)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines: 50, 75</li>
<li>Potential performance issues due to excessive memory use when cloning large data structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the findings indicate significant security and stability concerns, particularly around account handling and arithmetic operations, that should be addressed to enhance the application’s robustness.</p>
