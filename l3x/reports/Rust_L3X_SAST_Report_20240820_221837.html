    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class='markdown-summary'>
        <p>The Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool flagged several issues in the project codebase, highlighting significant security and performance concerns. Here's a summary:</p>
<h3>High Severity Issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow</strong>: Multiple instances of unchecked arithmetic operations were found across the code, which can lead to overflow or underflow vulnerabilities (specifically at lines 48 in <code>lib.rs</code> and lines 42, 74, 79, 92, 111, 112, 118, and 119 in <code>processor.rs</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Medium Severity Issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boundary Checks</strong>: Several lines in <code>processor.rs</code> (lines 17, 18, 54, 69) are accessing arrays or vectors without proper boundary checks, which could result in panics or potential buffer overflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Low Severity Issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloning Large Data Structures</strong>: Instances of cloning large data structures were flagged in <code>processor.rs</code> on lines 53, 65, and 96, raising concerns about performance issues due to excessive memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>The code requires immediate remediation of the high-priority unchecked arithmetic operations and boundary checks to avoid potential overflow/underflow vulnerabilities and buffer overflows. Additionally, the low-priority performance issues involving unnecessary cloning of large data structures should also be reviewed.</p>

The sum of these values is a compile-time constant and is not affected by runtime operations. There is no risk of overflow here, as Rust's compile-time checks ensure that the resolved value is well within the bounds of `u64`. Thus, there is no security issue, and this should be considered a false positive.</td>  <!-- Add explanation column -->
